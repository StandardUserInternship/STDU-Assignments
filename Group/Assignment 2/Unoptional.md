### Requirements
1. A program that accepts a string from the user and changes each uppercase & lowercase letter to the other case. This should be done without the SwapCase function.
2. A program that accepts a string from the user and parses the input for Roman Numerials. Display the sum of all the Roman Numerials that were in the input.
3. A program that returns longest non repeating output in the shortest amount of bytes
4. A program that accepts a 4 digit number from the user and proves [Kaprekar's constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6174_(number))
5. A program that takes a list of integers as input and returns the second largest number in the list. 
6. A program that takes a single number and returns the factorial of that number, without using math libraries. (n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1)
7. A program that uses a public [Currency Converter API](https://fixer.io/) to convert a user chosen amount of one currency to another currency, with both currencies chosen by the user.
