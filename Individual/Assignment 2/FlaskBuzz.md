# FizzBuzz

---

## Introduction
FizzBuzz is one of the most popular programming assignments given to beginners or interviewees. This assignment is a great way to learn the basics of programming, as it covers a wide range of topics including loops, conditionals, and basic math. It can be solved in any programming language, so itâ€™s a great way to start learning a new language as well.
This time you'll be using Flask to display the output of FizzBuzz instead of the terminal.
